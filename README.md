### Hi there, my name is Rahul! 👋

- I'm currently🔭 working on a pokemon web application game that mimics the original top-down pokemon gamesthat nintendo has created in the past. I am also working on a spotify playlist generator for daring music listeners that want to try out new music. Both projects will be soon released in Fall 2022!!
-👨🏾‍💻 I'm currently working as a Software Developer Intern at [Verizon](https://www.verizon.com/), where I work and develop digital content using C# and Solidity to create utility NFT Tokens and smart contracts for Verizon's private blockchain server. Currently I collaborate with Razer and Hi-Rez to bring enhanced mobile experience to users. I work in the R&D team😄, so I'm always learning new technology!⚡
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and frameworks such as three.js and vue.js. I am also learning how to use tensorflow and other AI/ML algorithms and content. 
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach out to me at nalam.4@buckeyemail.osu.edu
- 📜 You can view my past work history on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-nalam-0976411b1/) profile.

- I also worked on Variefy, a Spotify playlist generator app that recommends new and unfamiliar music that is similar to your current music taste using K-Means machine learning algorithm and the Spotify API!

- Please feel free to reach out to me anytime, always looking for new oppurtunities and ways to collaborate!👯

One thing that I want to clarify is that this github profile is different from others, as a 👨‍💼business enthusiast I like to showcase my quantitative 💵trading abilities! I am also decentralized so basically I am an open book, you can check out a repo with my stock portfolio!
